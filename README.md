###  :octocat: Hi there, I'm Katharina SchlÃ¼ter!


I currently study in the Master's program 'Information Systems Management' at the [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) hoping to switch to the Master's program 'Computer Science' soon. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in 'Business Computing' with a thesis on SQL injection using the [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) and [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/).  

:racing_car: I'm spending a lot of my free time coding, working and building in the Formula Student Team [FaSTTUBe](https://fasttube.de/). I started in the team working on state estimation and actuation and am now coding for the driving decision module in our driverless racing car.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [specialization on applied data science with python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) on Coursera.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of swedish. Hej!
- âœ¨ I'm currently procrastinating by reading stuff about RFID/NFC implants.
- <img height="16px" src="./images/ubuntu.png" /> I'm using Ubuntu and I think it's great.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via LinkedIn [<img height="18px" src="./images/LinkedIn.png" />](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharina-schl%C3%BCter-5077b5166/) or mail (katharina.schlueter(:envelope:)campus.tu-berlin.de).
