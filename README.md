###  :octocat: Hi there, I'm Katharina SchlÃ¼ter!


I currently study in the Master's program 'Information Systems Management' at the [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) hoping to switch to the Master's program 'Computer Science' soon. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in 'Business Computing' with a thesis on SQL injection using the [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) and [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/).  

I'm spending a lot of my free time coding, working and building in the Formula Student Team [FaSTTUBe](https://fasttube.de/) where I'm responsible for state estimation and actuation in our driverless racing car :racing_car:.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [specialization on applied data science with python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) on Coursera.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work with Matlab and Simulink.
- âœ¨ I'm currently procrastinating by playing with LED strips and my Arduino.
